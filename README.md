# Deep Learning
Keras and TensorFlow are among the most popular frameworks when it comes to Deep Learning.
Frameworks are a collection of packages and libraries which help in simplifying the overall programming experience for building a specific kind of application. 

# Tensor Flow
open source library to help you develop and train ML models
Tensor means vectors or matrices used to represent data in deep learning

# Keras
high-level neural networks APIs

In this repo, we built Neural Network model using Keras and [Fashion MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) data.
